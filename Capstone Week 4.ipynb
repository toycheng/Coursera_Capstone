We will then explore and analyse each railway station by using the explore function to get the most common venue categories, and use this feature to group the railway station into clusters. We will use the k-means clustering algorithm and examine the charateristics of each clusters. We will print each railway staion along with the top 5 most common venues. Finally, We will use the folium library to visualize the railway stations in the Sydney city centre and their emerging cluster.",

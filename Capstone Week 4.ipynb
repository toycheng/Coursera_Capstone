We will analyse each neighborhood by using the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. We will then use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task and examine the charateristics of each clusters. We will print each neighborhood along with the top 5 most common venues. Finally, We will use the folium library to visualize the neighborhools in the Sydney city centre and their emerging cluster.",
